#SBA 307 and 308 - HTML and JavaScript

In this SBA. I have used the opportunity to begin working on the MVP for my capstone project. The goal of the project is to build an application that allow users to create a digital grocery shopping to do list. This will help users to never forget to purchase all the ingredients necessary for their weekly meal prep schedule of meals. The pages that have been implemented for this SBA are: the index.html (Home page), the login page, the pricing page and the registration page.

The requirements for the assessment and where they have been implemented are as follows:
